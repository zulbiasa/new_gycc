# Golden Years Care Connect (GYCC)

<p align="justify">The ageing population is growing quickly worldwide, especially in Malaysia, where the number of senior citizens
(people aged 70 and above) continues to rise. Older adults often face unique challenges, such as health issues,
limited mobility, and social isolation, which require special care and support.</p>

<p align="justify">Golden Years Care Connect is a caregiving system and mobile app designed to address these needs. This platform
provides personalized care plans, real-time communication between caregivers, seniors, and their families,
medication reminders, activity tracking to encourage physical movement, emergency alerts for immediate
assistance, and tools for family engagement to keep families informed and involved.</p>

<p align="justify">The project will focus on developing and launching the app’s main features, ensuring it is easy to use, secure, and
follows healthcare guidelines. This platform is important because it addresses the growing demand for effective
senior care in Malaysia by providing a solution that meets the physical and emotional needs of older adults while
also helping caregivers and family members stay connected and involved.
Golden Years Care Connect aims to improve the lives of senior citizens by offering a safe, efficient, and
compassionate way to support them, giving peace of mind to their families and enhancing the caregiving
experience for all.</p>

## Problem Statement

<p align="justify">Aging is a natural part of life, but for many seniors, it can be accompanied by significant challenges,
particularly for those who live alone or far from their children. As individuals age, they may face a
variety of physical, emotional, and social difficulties that can impact their overall well-being. These
problems can range from practical difficulties to emotional and psychological issues.</p>

## Objective

The objectives of the project are: -
  1. To develop a systematic and modern digital solution that provides personalized care, improves caregiver efficiency, and enhances family engagement.
  2. To design a scalable and sustainable digital solution that can accommodate a growing user base and evolving care needs.
  3. To improve the care quality, promote better health outcomes, and enhance the overall well-being of senior citizens through digital solutions.
  4. To ensure data security and privacy while promoting a user-friendly experience.

## Project Significant

<p align="justify">The increasing ageing population in Malaysia and worldwide has inspired this project. Many senior
citizens face challenges such as health issues, reduced mobility, and social isolation, often resulting
in a lower quality of life. With limited caregiving options, there is a growing need for a solution that
empowers caregivers, fosters family involvement, and enhances senior citizens’ overall well-being</p>
